# Supervised_Machine_Learning
The Scikit-based_ANN.py is artificial neural network model of a sin function made using scikit-learn library in python environment; <br />
Using MLP Regressor (since we are extracting features of a non-linear data), a total number of seven hidden layers are utilized, with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLu) as an activation fnc; <br/>
The output Scikit-based_ANN.png plots the original data against the predicted data. The overlap of predicated data over the original data shows the fine tuning of the NN model.
